## Overview of the Project

### Project : Exploratory Data Analysis on Students

## Objective:
Identify patterns in student performance based on
Gender Performance differences between males and females.
Ethnic Group Differences among groups A, B, C, etc.
Parental Education Impact of parental education levels.
Lunch TypeEffect of free/reduced vs. standard lunch.
Test PreparationInfluence of completing test preparation.
## Dataset:
Gender(Male or Female)
Ethnic Group( A, B, C, D, E)
Parental Education( High school, bachelor’s, associate’s, etc.)
Lunch Type(Free/reduced or standard)
Test Preparation( Completed or not)
Scores( Math, Reading, Writing (0-100))

## Methodology:
**Data Understanding:**
Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, range of scores.
Data Exploration: Categories in gender, lunch type.

**Data Cleaning:**
Handling Missing Data: Ensure completeness.
Column Selection: Remove redundant columns.

**Data Visualization:**
Histograms & Box Plots: Score distributions.
Correlation Analysis: Heatmap of relationships.
Scatter Plots: Effects of gender, lunch type, test preparation.
Pair Plots: Overall relationships among numeric variables.

## Technologies Used 
**pandas:** Data Manipulation: Load, clean, and process your data. Functions like read_csv(), dropna(), and groupby() will be helpful.

**seaborn:** Data Visualization: Create attractive and informative statistical graphics. Use functions like sns.histplot(), sns.boxplot(), sns.heatmap(), and sns.pairplot().

**matplotlib:** Plot Customization: Complement Seaborn with detailed customization. Use functions like plt.figure(), plt.plot(), and plt.show().

## Key Insights:
Gender Impact: Differences in math, reading, and writing scores based on gender.
Lunch Type Influence: The effect of lunch type (free/reduced or standard) on overall performance.
Test Preparation: How completing test preparation affects scores in various subjects.
Correlation between Subjects: Examining how closely math, reading, and writing scores are related.

The project reveals key relationships between student performance and demographic factors. Insights drawn can be used to help educators understand which groups might need additional support, and how factors like lunch type or test prep impact student success.
